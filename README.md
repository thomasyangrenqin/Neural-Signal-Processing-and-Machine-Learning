## Neural Signal Processing and Machine Learning
---
This repository contains the whole homework assignments and final project of Neural Signal Processing and Machine Learning([course website](https://elec548.github.io/)), one of the most interesting, challenging and technically promising courses I've taken at Rice University.

 The course covered a range of techniques and their application to basic neuroscience and neural interfaces. More importantly, it covered lots of machine learning algorithms, including their mathematic principles and applications to decode and analysis neuron singles.
 
 It also heavily used Python, known as the most efficient tool in machine learning field, to complete homework and project. This course challenged and refined both my Python programming skills and the understanding to multiple algorithm.

| Final Project | [Final Project](https://elec548.github.io/Assignments/finalproject.html) | [Final Project](https://github.com/thomasyangrenqin/Neural-Signal-Processing-and-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Final%20Project-Improving%20Neural%20Prosthetic%20System%20Performance%20by%20Combining%20Plan%20and%20Peri-Movement%20Activity) |

In the Final Project, my major task is to replicate the key results from the paper, the Fig.4 “Comparison of cross-validated decode
performance ” , demonstrating the differences and accuracy improvement by using both types of activity. I used the similar data from Homework 5  to replicated the key results. Although, the final replicated results have minor discrepancy against the original results, I got the same conclusion with the paper from my replicated results.
